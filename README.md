# Smart Solutions Tech Shop

For my **Portfolio  Project** on the **Code Institute's Diploma in Software Development (E-commerce Applications)** course I have created an online e-commerce Website for a shop called Smart Solutions.  

Smart solutions is a smart technology shop that sells all sorts of household and personal smart technology.  It’s main objective is to provide a variety of technologies for simplifying life and creating the environment you want. 

Link to the deployed app is [here](https://smart-solutions-jmp.herokuapp.com).

## Objective?

-----

Smart solutions is designed as an e-commerce website to get users to purchase Smart technologies. 

## User Experience

### User Stories

|Link | User Story | Sprint/Satisfied |

### Agile Methodology - UX

To plan this project I used agile methodology.  This was done using Github and the Project Board before starting the project.

Link to the project app is [here]().

I used the the Kanban board and in particular Milestones for sprints.  I was able to divide the project into different sprints such as:

1. Preparation
1. Basic Setup
1. Payments
1. New Models
1. Store Management
1. Design Completion

For better organisation I used both the Table View and Kanban view. The Kanban view meant I could put each issue into a different section, No status, In progress, Complete and Wishlist.

<details open>
<summary>Kanban View</summary> 
<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/rockymiss/image/upload/v1668720459/mcgraths/kanban-view_hsmknk.png"></p>

</details>

I could also use the Kanban view to move all or remaining issues for each sprint into the "in progress" section so I was only working on issues for a particularl sprint. 

<details open>
<summary>Kanban View Sprints</summary> 
<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/rockymiss/image/upload/v1669152493/mcgraths/sprint-view_ylaloh.png"></p>

</details>

The table view allowed me to view all of the issues in each sprint clearly so I could see what was left to be done in each sprint.  

<details open>
<summary>Table View</summary> 
<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/rockymiss/image/upload/v1668720518/mcgraths/table-view-agile_dzhxti.png"></p>

</details>

Issues were created by way of User Stories or Admin User Stories and any other elements required to complete the database.  User stories were labelled/grouped according to MoSCoW prioritization technique.While working on a particular user story they were moved into ‘In progress’.  Once completed they were moved to ‘completed’.  This gave a better view of what was to be completed and what had already been completed.  As work was committed to the github repository each issue was marked completed which automatically moved to the ‘completed’ section on the Kanban Board.

## Wireframes

Link to the wireframes app is [here](https://github.com/rockymiss/mcrocks-shop/blob/main/Wireframes.pdf).

## Flow Chart

I used this simple flow chart to give me a basic flow of the website.

## SEO & Marketing

-----

### Marketing

Questions that I asked myself before starting this website:

**Who are your users?**

children
parents
amateur cake makers
professional cake makers

**Which online platforms and social media would you find lots of your users?**

Facebook, Instagram, TikTok

**What do your users need?  Could you meet that need with useful content? If yes, how could you best deliver that content to them?**

Gift ideas for occasions and cake making tips or ideas.  I would like to showcase users cakes which would give amateur cake makers ideas for making their own cakes.

**Would your business run sales or offer discounts?  How do you think your users would most like to hear about these offers?**

Yes it would run offers.  I would like to do this by way of newsletter so that only members that have signed up will receive the offer.  This would hopefully get more users to sign up to the newsletter.

**What are the goals of your business?  Which marketing strategies would offer the best ways to meet those goals?**

To sell cake supplies and bring people back to the website.  I would use email marketing and social media marketing.  The space for users to upload their cake images is also a way to bring people back to the website. 

**Would your business have a budget to spend on advertising?  Or would it need to work with free or low cost options to market itself?**

No the business is too small for an advertising budget so marketing will be done on social media and email for now with a few to having a budget further down the line when the business expands.


### Keywords

After brainstorming keywords for this website using wordtracker.com[Wordtracker.com](https://www.wordtracker.com/) I used the following:

1. Simple cake design
1. Decorating cake ideas
1. Cake design ideas
1. Cake toppers ireland
1. personalised cake toppers
1. birthday cake design
1. wedding cake design

<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/rockymiss/image/upload/v1668719894/mcgraths/cake-toppers-keywords_kwixxj.png"></p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/rockymiss/image/upload/v1668719894/mcgraths/cake-design-keywords_g2xxpz.png"></p>

### Content

Questions I asked myself in relation to content?

**What do your users need?**

cake supplies
cake boards and boxes
cake toppers
cake toppings
cookie cutters
piping bags and nozzles
icing
food colouring

**What information and features can you provide to meet those needs?**

A clear display of all cake supplies.  The titles for each item must be clear and in the correct category.  Pricing should be easily seen and it should be easy for the user to purchase items and add or remove from the shopping cart.

**How can you make the information easy to understand?**

By using clear and easy language with easy to read typography for all readers.  Clear images with a good description on alt text, clear categories and titles, simple payment process, and an intuitive and clear design.  

**How can you demonstrate expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness in your content?**

Pages such as Home, About Us, Returns Policy, Frequently Ask Questions, Privacy and Contact.

**Would there be other pages within your own site you could link to from your chosen page?**

Cake Supplies, Post a picture of your cake, error pages

**Are there opportunities to link back to external websites that already rank highly on Google?**

Links to purchasers who are local cake makers.  This would show loyality to clients with a view to keeping them as clients.

## Testing

I have created a seperate md file for [Testing](TESTING.md).

## Version Control


### Git and GitHub 

Local repository and IDE used: GitPod
Remote repository used: GitHub

Steps followed: 
- I created a new public repository on GitHub using the Code Institute template.
- I then created a workspace and started coding on GitPod. 
- All relevant files were created. 
- To save my work safely I continued to use the terminal consistently by using: 
    - **git add .** to add work to git
    - **git commit -m""** to commit the work 
    - **git push** to update work to GitHub 


### Deployment to Heroku

Deployment is done after Creating the Django Project in your virtual environment.  To create the project the following need to be carried out:-

| Steps | **Notes/Code**
|:-------:|:--------|
| Install Django and gunicorn| pip install django gunicorn
| Install any supporting libraries| pip install dj_database_url psycopg2
| Create requirements.txt| pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
| Create Django Project  | django-admin startproject **project name**
| Create apps | python manage.py startapp **app name**
| Add app to list of installed apps in settings.py ||
| Make migrations | python3 manage.py makemigrations
| Migrate Changes | python3 manage.py migrate
| Test server locally | python3 manage.py runserver
| Procfile | python run.py > Procfile
| Push changes to github repository | git add. git commit and git push
| Create new app on Heroku | https://dashboard.heroku.com/


1. Click on "Resources tab" underneath the "Add-ons" section.
1. Search of Heroku Postgres and attach it to your app.
1. Click on "Settings" tab and open "Config Vars" where you will see that a new Postgrest database URL has been automatically applied.
1. The following environment variables should be included:

|  | **Environment Variables**
|:-------:|:--------|
